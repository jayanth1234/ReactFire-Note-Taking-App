# ReactFire-Note-Taking-App

This Note taking app is built using ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3 and Flexbox as well. Also it maintains the data using the Firebase database where we can check the note that we type in the app which is stored in the database. This app is the combination of React And Firebase as well which will link to front-end to the back-end.
